## Installation


For this project I use Visual Studio Code to write my code. There is other better platform that offer better setup for 
Java project such as Eclipse where they provided windowbuilder that make it more easier to code GUI project. But to get 
comfortable using Visual Studio Code i decided to code here.

1.  Download the Frame.java, Main.java, GYM Record.jar, and bar curl.png
2.  Change location of the file align with your computer
3.  Run GYM Record.jar

Actually planning im going to put QR code to scan then the GYM Record.jar will be executed but i unable to show since it within my computer. The location is correct.
